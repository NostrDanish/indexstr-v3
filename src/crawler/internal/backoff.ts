/**
 * backoff.ts — bounded exponential backoff with jitter for transient
 * fetch failures (blueprint §4: "retry ≤3 with backoff; jobs don't spin").
 *
 * Schedule (before jitter): attempt 1 → 30 s, 2 → 2 m, 3 → 8 m, then the
 * 10-minute cap binds. Jitter is ±25% (full jitter would cluster retries
 * near zero; a bounded band keeps politeness while decorrelating nodes
 * that fail at the same moment — thundering-herd protection).
 *
 * The delay is stored on the job's `nextAttempt`; the queue's nextJob
 * cursor skips future-dated jobs, so a backed-off job never spins the
 * crawl loop.
